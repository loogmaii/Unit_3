An Accounting firm needs a software package to calculate compound interest. Draw the UML diagram.

A CompoundInterest class is used to calculate the compound interest of a given principal, rate and number of years with the equation principal * (1 + rate) ** years

The AccountingProgram class provides a set of methods to set the principal, rate and years, and a calculate_interest method that gets the compound interest by calling the calculate method of the compound_interest_calculator object.
