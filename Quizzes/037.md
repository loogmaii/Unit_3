# Quiz 37

An Accounting firm needs a software package to calculate compound interest. Draw the UML diagram.

A CompoundInterest class is used to calculate the compound interest of a given principal, rate and number of years with the equation principal * (1 + rate) ** years

There is a AccountingProgram class that uses composition to include an object of the CompoundInterest class, which it uses to perform the interest calculation.
The AccountingProgram class provides a set of methods to set the principal, rate and years, and a calculate_interest method that gets the compound interest by calling the calculate method of the compound_interest_calculator object.

## Code

```py
class CompoundInterest:
    def __init__(self, principal:int, rate:int, years:int):
        self.principal = principal
        self.rate = rate
        self.years = years

    def calculate(self):
        return self.principal * (1 + self.rate) ** self.years

class AccountingProgram:
    def __init__(self):
        self.compound = CompoundInterest(0,0,0)
    def set_principal(self,principal):
        if principal>0:
            self.compound.pricipal = principal
        else:
            raise ValueError("Principal should be greater than zero")
        self.compound.principal = principal
        return f"Principal set to {self.compound.principal}"

    def set_rate(self, rate):
        if rate>0:
            self.compound.rate = rate
        else:
            raise ValueError("Interest rate should be greater than zero")
        self.compound.rate = rate
        return f"Rate set to {self.compound.rate}"

    def set_years(self, years):
        if years > 0:
            self.compound.years = years
        else:
            raise ValueError("Years should be greater than zero")
        self.compound.year = years
        return f"Year set to {self.compound.year}"

    def calculate_interest(self):
        calculate = self.compound.principal * (1 + self.compound.rate) ** self.compound.years
        decimal = "{:.2f}".format(calculate)
        return float(decimal)

```
