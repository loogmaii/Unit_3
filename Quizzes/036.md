# Quiz 36

SL: ① Create the classes described below ② UML diagram.

There is a Person class with two attributes, name and age, and two methods get_name() and get_age(). The attributes are initialized in the constructor method __init__(), and the methods are used to retrieve the values of the attributes. There is another class called Student which inherits from the Person class. It has a unique attribute grade and method get_grade().

## Code

```py
class Person:
    def __init__(self,name:str,age:int):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    def get_name(self)->str:
        return self.name.title()
    def get_age(self):
        return self.age

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name:str, age:int, grade:int):
        super().__init__(name = name, age = age)
        self.grade = grade
    def get_grade(self):
        return self.grade

bob = Student(name='Bob', age = 13, grade = 11)
print(f"{bob.get_name()} is {bob.get_age()} years old and is in Grade {bob.get_grade()}")
```
